# warsawjs-workshop-11-smart-cookbook-description
This repository contains description and requirements for WarsawJS workshop 11 application. Because topic is `Advanced React.js`, we decided that we should choose interesting main theme, allowing us to use some sophisticated libraries and techniques. 

## Theme
As you probably already deduced from title, main theme is `Smart Cookbook`. We'll provide backend server with some recipes, and ability to query them and add our own. On the frontend side, during workshop we'll try to create application displaying recipes and filtering them based on ingredients.
